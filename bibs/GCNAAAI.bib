Conventional graph convolution methods for modeling skeleton structure consider only physically connected neighbors of each joint, and the joints of the same type, thus failing to capture highorder information. In this work, we propose a novel model with motif-based graph convolution to encode hierarchical spatial structure, and a variable temporal dense block to exploit local temporal information over different ranges of human skeleton sequences. Moreover, we employ a non-local block to capture global dependencies of temporal domain in an attention mechanism. Our model achieves improvements over the stateof-the-art methods on two large-scale datasets.&lt;/p&gt;}, number={01}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Wen, Yu-Hui and Gao, Lin and Fu, Hongbo and Zhang, Fang-Lue and Xia, Shihong}, year={2019}, month={Jul.}, pages={8989-8996} }
